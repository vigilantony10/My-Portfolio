# My-Portfolio

This website showcases my skills, experiences, and projects that I have worked on. I designed and developed this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate my abilities in web development.

To view the website, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. From there, you will be able to navigate through the various pages and sections of the website, including my bio, skills, projects, and contact information. The website features a modern, clean, and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. I have included examples of my work, including links to live projects and GitHub repositories, to provide a deeper understanding of my skills and experiences. Please note that some of the external links in the project section may require an internet connection to access. Additionally, it is recommended that you use a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari for the best experience.

Thank you for taking the time to view my Portfolio Website. If you have any feedback or questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
